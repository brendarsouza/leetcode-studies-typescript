In order to detect errors on identification numbers, a check digit is often added at the end of that number.
Implement the function computeCheckDigit (identificationNumber) that takes a number (as a string) and returns the check digit, using the following algorithm:
    • Sum the digits in the even-numbered positions (positions 0, 2, 4, etc.).
    • Multiply the result by three.
    • Add the digits in the odd-numbered positions to the result (positions 1, 3, 5, etc.).
    • Take the last digit of the result.
    • If it's not 0, subtract this digit from 10. Otherwise, keep it as 0.
    • Return the result (Assuming that the first digit on the left has the position O)

Example:
Given the identification number 39847 :
    • Sum the digits in the even-numbered positions: 3 + 8 + 7 = 18
    • Multiplied by three: 18 x 3 = 54
    • Add the digits in the odd-numbered positions: 54 + (9 + 4) = 67
    • Last digit: 7
    • Subtract 7 from 10: 10 - 7 = 3
The expected result is 3 for 39847
