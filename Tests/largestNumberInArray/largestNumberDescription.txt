 /**
   * 
   * Implement the function findLargest (numbers), so it returns the largest number from the array numbers
      Notes:
      numbers contains only integers.
      numbers always contains at least one element, and never contains more than 10 elements.
      â€¢ The integers are ranged from -2^31 to +2^31 - 1 (they always fit in a 32-bit
      signed integer).
   * @param nums 
      
      Test Cases      
      1 Array of positives [42, 10, 75, 3], expect return 75
      2 Array of negatives [-42, -19, -123, -1337], expect return -1337
