# Leetcode Studies in TypeScript

This repository contains my personal solutions to Leetcode problems, implemented in TypeScript. The aim is to improve my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency through consistent practice.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a different Leetcode problem or topic.
- Solutions are organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) or problem category (e.g., Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Linked Lists, etc.).
- Each solution includes the problem description, approach, and TypeScript code.
  
## Future Improvements

- As I progress, I will continue to update this repository with new problems and more optimized solutions.
- I also plan to add explanations and time complexity analysis for each solution.
